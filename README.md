# Week3 - JavaScript and the Document Object Model (DOM)

## Business competences

JavaScript is one of the most demanded programming skills. [ref: it.jobindex.dk](https://it.jobindex.dk/jobsoegning?q=javascript&supid=1)

JavaScript this semester will provide students with the background to join modern front-end teams, using JS and supplementing JS frameworks/libraries.

## Important about our references for JavaScript
*There are tons of JavaScript articles on the Web. The two "major" resources are https://www.w3schools.com/ and MDN (Mozilla). Usually, articles from the first, are easier to read, more light weight, and often not quite as up to date as MDN. MDN should be considered the reference documentation.
Often when you Google, articles from w3schools will pop up first. If you prefer MDN, add this to you search term, for example `javascript array MDN`. If you prefer w3, where you often can try things out, do "javascript array w3".*

*Don't always add W3 or MDN to your search queries, there are lots of other great sources out there.*

## Day 1 (11/2) - Introduction to JavaScript
*Quick introduction to JavaScript, a new language which you will use throughout the semester, either alone, as in this flow, or in combination with libraries like React, to create cool dynamic web pages.*

### Before this lesson you should
- :green_book: The [MDN JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/bm/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Introduction) (Skip these sections: Regular expressions, Keyed collections, Details of the object model and the remaining sections) 
- :tv: [Course on Lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com/JavaScript-tutorials/Welcome/574716/612017-4.html?srchtrk=index%3a3%0alinktypeid%3a2%0aq%3ajavascript%0apage%3a1%0as%3arelevance%0asa%3atrue%0aproducttypeid%3a2) - section 1 - 4 + 9 (just skip sections you find to trivial)

## Day 2 (12/2) - Document Object Model (DOM)
*An introduction to the Document Object Model (DOM).  The "thing" we can manipulate with JavaScript to dynamically change the content on a page*
### Before this lesson you should
- :green_book: [W3Schools.com - HTML Document Object Model]( https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp) Read/skim all chapters until and including DOM Event Listener. Complete as many of the examples/exercises as you have time for, while you read.
